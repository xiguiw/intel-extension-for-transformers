.. py:function:: select_best_resolution(original_size, possible_resolutions)

   Selects the best resolution from a list of possible resolutions based on the original size.

   :param original_size: The original size of the image in the format (width, height).
   :type original_size: tuple
   :param possible_resolutions: A list of possible resolutions in the format [(width1, height1),
   :type possible_resolutions: list
   :param (width2:
   :param height2):
   :param ...].:

   :returns: The best fit resolution in the format (width, height).
   :rtype: tuple


.. py:function:: get_anyres_image_grid_shape(image_size, grid_pinpoints, patch_size)

   Calculate the shape of the image patch grid after the preprocessing for images of any resolution.

   :param image_size: The size of the input image in the format (width, height).
   :type image_size: tuple
   :param grid_pinpoints: A string representation of a list of possible resolutions.
   :type grid_pinpoints: str
   :param patch_size: The size of each image patch.
   :type patch_size: int

   :returns: The shape of the image patch grid in the format (width, height).
   :rtype: tuple
