# Documentation Overview and Installation


You can find install guidelines in [installation.html](installation.html).

These documents offer a comprehensive description of Intel Extension for Transformers:


- [architecture.html](architecture.html): Provides an overview of Intel Extension for Transformers, covering various architectural levels.
- [installation.html](installation.html): Contains installation guidelines.

# Optimization and Inference Documentation

**Optimization Documentation**:

- [quantization.html](quantization.html): Covers quantization techniques.
- [pruning.html](pruning.html): Details the pruning process.
- [autodistillation.html](autodistillation.html) and [distillation.html](distillation.html): Discuss distillation methods.
- [export.html](export.html): Explains PyTorch to ONNX, including the int8 model.
- [get_started.html](get_started.html): Guides you through using the optimization API and sparse inference.


We also provide examples in [examples.html](examples.html). P.S., smoothquant, weight-only quantization, and cpp inference are not in these documents. SmoothQuant: [smoothquant.html](smoothquant.html), weight-only quantization: [weightonlyquant.html](weightonlyquant.html).

**API Documentation**:


For comprehensive API guidance, visit the [API doc](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-transformers/latest/docs/Welcome.html), generated using [api_doc](api_doc) and [build_docs](build_docs). You can disregard the two mentioned folders.

**Examples**:

Practical examples can be found in [examples.html](examples.html). Note that `smoothquant`, `weight-only quantization`, and `cpp inference` are not covered in these documents. For specific information on these topics:

- [smoothquant.html](smoothquant.html): SmoothQuant
- [weightonlyquant.html](weightonlyquant.html): Weight-Only Quantization
