# Intel® Extension for Transformers: Accelerating Transformer-based Models on Intel Platforms
 Intel® Extension for Transformers is an innovative toolkit to accelerate Transformer-based models on Intel platforms, in particular effective on 4th Intel Xeon Scalable processor Sapphire Rapids (codenamed [Sapphire Rapids](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/xeon-accelerated/4th-gen-xeon-scalable-processors.html)). The toolkit provides the below key features and examples:


*  Seamless user experience of model compressions on Transformer-based models by extending [Hugging Face transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) APIs and leveraging [Intel® Neural Compressor](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor)


*  Advanced software optimizations and unique compression-aware runtime (released with NeurIPS 2022's paper [Fast Distilbert on CPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07715) and [QuaLA-MiniLM: a Quantized Length Adaptive MiniLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17114), and NeurIPS 2021's paper [Prune Once for All: Sparse Pre-Trained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05754))


*  Optimized Transformer-based model packages such as [Stable Diffusion](examples/huggingface/pytorch/text-to-image/deployment/stable_diffusion), [GPT-J-6B](examples/huggingface/pytorch/text-generation/deployment), [GPT-NEOX](examples/huggingface/pytorch/language-modeling/quantization#2-validated-model-list), [BLOOM-176B](examples/huggingface/pytorch/language-modeling/inference#BLOOM-176B), [T5](examples/huggingface/pytorch/summarization/quantization#2-validated-model-list), [Flan-T5](examples/huggingface/pytorch/summarization/quantization#2-validated-model-list) and end-to-end workflows such as [SetFit-based text classification](tutorials/pytorch/text-classification/SetFit_model_compression_AGNews.ipynb) and [document level sentiment analysis (DLSA)](workflows/dlsa) 

*  [NeuralChat](workflows/chatbot), a custom Chatbot trained on Intel CPUs through parameter-efficient fine-tuning [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) on domain knowledge
