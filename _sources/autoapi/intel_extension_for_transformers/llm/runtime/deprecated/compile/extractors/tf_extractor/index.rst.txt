.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   The neural engine tensorflow extractor file.

   Extract all nodes in the input tensorflow model and convert them to engine python operators.
   All these python operators will compose the engine graph in the order of the original tensorflow
   calculation graph. Please noticed that the mapping between operators is not one-to-one
   correspondence. For more related deatils, please refer to 'ops' APIs.

.. py:class:: TensorflowExtractor




   The tensorflowExtractor Class.

   Decorate the node in model.graph_def, and the new node has the attributes like input_tensors
   and output_tensors, these tensors record the source/dest op name. All of these nodes
   (in a list) will compose a graph, which is Graph class, as the return object.

   :param model: TensorflowModel

   :returns: Graph class, the new graph object
   :rtype: Graph
