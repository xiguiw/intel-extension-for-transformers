.. py:class:: AutoDistillation(model_builder, conf_fname_or_obj, framework='pytorch')




   The framework class is designed for handling the whole pipeline of AutoDistillation.

   AutoDistillation is composed of three major stages, i.e. Model Exploration, Flash Distillation,
   and Evaluation.
   In Model Exploration, a search engine will search for a better compressed model from the architecture
   design space in each iteration.
   Flash Distillation is the stage for training the searched model to discover its potential.
   In Evaluation stage, the trained model will be evaluated to measure its performances (e.g.
   the prediction accuracy, the hardware performance etc.) in order to select the best model architecture.

   .. py:method:: search(res_save_path=None, model_cls=None)

      Auto distillation search process.

      :returns: Best model architecture found in search process.


   .. py:method:: estimate(model)

      Train and evaluate the model.

      :returns: Evaluated metrics of the model.


   .. py:method:: load_search_results(path)

      Load previous search results.

      :param path: The file path which stores the previous results.


   .. py:method:: init_by_cfg(conf_fname_or_obj)

      Use auto distillation config to init the instance of autodistillation.


   .. py:method:: create_distillers()

      Create flash and regular distillers.
